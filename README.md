Hello,

This tutorial is for machine learning beginners who want to learn quickly pandas ans scikit learn's features.

All you need to do is to open the jupyter notebook and follow all the steps. We work on kaggle's titanic problem as an example. If you want to learn more about the used data, it is from [here](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/data).
 
Please, do not hesitate to contact me if you have a question or a remark.
